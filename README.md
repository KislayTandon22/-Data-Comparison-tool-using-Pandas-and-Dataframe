# -Data-Comparison-tool-using-Pandas-,DataFrame,-and-Matplotlib
Developed a Pandas, DataFrame and Matplotlib-based project to compare healthcare facilities on successful child deliveries, providing valuable insights for healthcare improvement
This was one of my initial Projects. It was me exploring tools like Pandas and Dataframe. Though the code looks only 400 lines, It was a learning experience. Because it was my first time creating a project that had some use apart from the above features and tool that could be imported into Python.
What I learned other than the technical aspect.
1. How restricted programming languages, in general, are compared to what they can do.
2. How the data is stored or shared in the real world
3. How open source data generally works.
4. Government is more open than we think
Further improvements:
1. We can create a UI interface for the program with tools
2. Implementation of a machine learning model can help in prediction if we train data over multiple past data
3. Also, we can implement more flexibility on the type of chart and data availability.
Here is a bit about the data we were working on:
HMIS stands for Health Management Information System. It is a web-based Monitoring Information System of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare to monitor the National Health Mission and other National Health Programmes. It provides key inputs for policy formulation and appropriate program intervention
